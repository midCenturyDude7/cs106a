In its current form, this VERY BASIC program works with COVID-19 data from five countries and allows the user
to access data based on choosing which country he/she would like to see data about.
***
NEXT STEPS: (1) Provide access to all the files, likely using the OS module; (2) Include a date with each day;
(3) Data manipulation: Work with Numpy and Pandas to perform further/more detailed data manipulation such as
cross country comparisons based on certain data points related to 'confirmed cases' or 'country with the day
of the most confirmed cases', etc.; (4) Data visualization: Work with Matplotlib to plot the data and
hopefully create some useful/interesting charts/graphs for the purposes of storytelling (maybe); and
(5) Further decompose the program - likely related to #1 above - to simplify/refactor the code to make it more
efficient and easier to read.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST: THANK YOU CS106A!!! What an awesome, kick-ass, amazing and super-fun experience this has been.
Really can't say thank you enough! Everyone that contributed their time, energy and effort to this has my infinite
gratitude - and that is an understatement.

<UPDATE>
May 26: I need to update the program to correctly tabulate the total number of confirmed cases for a given country.
This will be done during the week of May 29.
